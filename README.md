# Electra-Artisans-Program

To develop the Electra artisans programmed system, the following guidelines need to be followed:-

A. The Electra artisans e-portal will be divided into two sections within a class like an online gallery(which will be displayed as a menu), where one section will be allocated
to the administrators to analyze the performance of their business by getting the businesses profit margin based on the cost of goods sold, the businesses's net income calculated,
determining the six sigma value of the business.

B. The other section will be for customers to find out about the local traditional arts and crafts sold in two Latin American countries(which are:- Mexico, and Bolivia). Two options 
will be provided to the customers which are: 1. Read the Iinformation(by playing an audio file) 2. Display an e-gallery of the traditional arts and crafts along with some information 
about the arts and crafts(without the need to play an audio file) for customers to learn about. The customers will also be able to purchase the arts and crafts of their choice in US dollars.

C. Administrators will be required to enter the correct username and password given to them to be able to gain authorized access to the Electra artisans e-system.

D. Conditional statements should be used to control what type of information would be displayed based on the customer's selection.

E. The correct finance formulas and calculations should be used to calculate the cost of goods, profit margin, and the six sigma value.

F. There should be at least two customer purchases to test the system. The customer's purchases and the businesses financial information needs to be computed by the Electra artisans 
programmed system and display the results.

G.Images will need to be included in the program to display the arts and crafts to the customers.
